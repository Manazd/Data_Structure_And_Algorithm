This project involves using a Treap (a combination of a binary search tree and a heap) to manage a sequence of items with operations such as merging items, querying maximum values, and performing XOR calculations on subsets of the sequence. The project has two phases:

### Phase 1:
- Implements basic operations on a Treap, including merging segments, finding maximum values, and performing circular shifts of elements.

### Phase 2:
- Adds an XOR calculation for ranges, checking if the XOR of values in a range is 0 or non-zero.
